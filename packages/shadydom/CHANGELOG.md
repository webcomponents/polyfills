All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.11.0] - 2022-10-20

- Add support for `Element.toggleAttribute()` ([#541](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/541))
- Update dependencies ([#542](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/542))

## [1.10.0] - 2022-10-20

- Fix focus/blur events to be usable without wrapped `addEventListener` in
  `noPatch` mode. ([#502](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/502))
- Add type annotations for JSCompiler to `eventPhase` property descriptor.
  ([#473](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/473))
- Allow event listener options to be specified using a function in addition to
  an object. ([#469](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/469))
- The `eventPhase` property of events is now properly set to `Event.AT_TARGET`
  when events are re-targeted to hosts of shadowRoots.
  ([#469](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/469))
- Adds an opt-out for polyfilling `element(s)FromPoint` on `document` via
  setting `ShadyDOM.useNativeDocumentEFP` to `true`.
  ([#472](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/472))
- In browsers where `EventTarget` doesn't exist, `XMLHttpRequest.prototype`'s
  `EventTarget`-like properties are now patched. In browsers where events'
  `currentTarget` is an own value property and Shady DOM needs to manually
  dispatch an event, Shady DOM will instead dispatch a new object having the
  original event as its prototype so that it can update `currentTarget` without
  modifying the built-in property descriptor.
  ([#519](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/519))
- Add `ShadyDOM.querySelectorImplementation` setting.
  ([#517](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/517))
- Fix Closure types of `querySelector{,All}` patches for internal conformance
  checks. ([#526](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/526))

## [1.9.0] - 2021-08-02

- Adds `element(s)FromPoint` to `document` and `shadowRoot`
  ([#463](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/463))
- Add TS externs. ([#457](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/457))
- When `EventTarget.prototype` exists but is not in the prototype chain of
  `window`, polyfill installation breaks.
  ([#416](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/pull/416))

## [1.8.0] - 2020-10-21
